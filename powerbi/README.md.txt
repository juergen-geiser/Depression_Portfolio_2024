# Power BI Analysis - Depression and Anxiety Dataset

## Objectives

This Power BI project was undertaken with the following objectives in mind:

1. **Data Cleansing and Preparation:**
   - **Handle Missing Values:** Systematically address missing data by categorizing columns into independent, dependent, and median-imputable groups.
   - **Consistency:** Ensure that data across all relevant columns is consistent, using dynamic methods such as median imputation and rule-based derivation for dependent columns.
   - **Data Integrity:** Remove rows with critical missing information in independent columns to maintain the reliability of the analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - **Derive Insights:** Provide meaningful insights into the correlations and patterns between depression, anxiety, and other related factors.
   - **Visualization:** Create clear, concise, and interactive visualizations to present the data and highlight key findings.
   - **Trend Identification:** Identify trends and potential indicators that could be useful for future data collection and analysis efforts.

3. **Automation and Reusability:**
   - **Implementing Rules:** Automate the data cleansing process through well-defined rules that can be applied to future datasets, ensuring ongoing data quality.
   - **Scalability:** Develop a methodology that is scalable and adaptable to larger datasets or evolving analytical needs.

## Outcome

The final Power BI file delivers a robust and reliable dataset ready for in-depth analysis. Key outcomes include:

1. **Clean Dataset:**
   - **777 Records:** The final dataset consists of 777 fully cleaned and validated records.
   - **Error-Free:** Independent columns were scrubbed of all NA values, while dependent columns were accurately reconstructed from their corresponding scores.

2. **Visual Insights:**
   - **Interactive Dashboards:** Users can explore the data through interactive visualizations that allow for deep dives into specific areas of interest.
   - **Trend Analysis:** The dashboards facilitate the identification of key trends in depression and anxiety metrics, offering potential insights into underlying causes or correlations.

3. **Repeatable Process:**
   - **Code Integration:** The data cleansing rules have been integrated into the Power BI process, ensuring that future datasets can be processed with the same level of rigor and accuracy.
   - **Documentation:** The approach is fully documented, providing clear guidelines for future use and adaptation to new datasets.

This Power BI project serves as a template for ongoing data analysis efforts in the mental health field, providing both immediate insights and a repeatable framework for future research and analysis.
